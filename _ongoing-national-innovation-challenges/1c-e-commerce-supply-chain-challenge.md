        <h5>Background</h5>
          Based on industry manpower landscape studies conducted by NEA, The Environmental Services (ES) industry comprising cleaning, waste, and pest management are essential services has a heavy reliance on low-skilled and manual labour, and an aging workforce. The current industry landscape is therefore labour intensive and unproductive. With a greater push and emphasis on the use of smart solutions to increase productivity in ES operations, the industry is seeing an increasing adoption of smart solutions to aid workers in their daily operations. This resulted in an increased offering of a wide array of smart solutions in the areas of Internet of things (IoT), robotics (e.g. vacuuming and scrubbing robot cleaners) and software solutions (e.g. Human Resource Management, Enterprise Resource Planning) to meet the demand. <br><br>

However, most off-the-shelf robotics and software solutions are singular function purpose-built tools to aid service buyers (SB) and service providers (SP) in yielding productivity improvements for specific tasks; but industry feedback that it neither offers substantial optimisation in resources nor an increase in service offerings from the SPs to the SBs or the SBs to their stakeholders at a broader whole-of-operations level. SBs and SPs typically maintains status quo at the worksites without visible value added offerings even with such smart solution implementations.  <br><br>

To yield visible improvements to service offerings and value proposition to their stakeholders, SBs agree that there is a need to scale up the implementation of multiple types of smart solutions in their premises, targeting changes to multiple work processes concurrently. SBs and SPs also see the need to draw on data information extracted from these smart solutions to derive an understanding of the conditions of their properties and resources utilised throughout the contract period to better manage their budgets. <br><br>

However, SBs and SPs feedback that they have limited access to the information/data provided by the smart solutions. Henceforth, they were unable to perform analytics and correlate data from different sources to derive new insights and operation approaches. Monitoring and tracking the condition of their properties, and service performance of their vendors digitally is therefore impossible too.<br><br>
 
Furthermore, from NEAâ€™s observations of the equipment available in market, existing solution offerings are typically built using proprietary protocols which might not be compatible for integration to provide seamless analytics of data and has them presented using an intuitive graphical user interface. In addition, users of a certain brand of smart solutions will be restricted to view collated data based on what it was built for (e.g. historical trend charts).  This create problems to SBs and SPs such as:<br>
1.	Necessity to subscribe to multiple proprietary software solutions<br>
2.	Monitoring of property conditions through toggling between multiple dashboard user interfaces that each smart solution provides <br>
3.	Usage of data information restricted to what the software is designed and built for<br>
4.	Inability to cross reference data inputs from multiple types of IoT devices to yield new insights and effect workflow improvements to building management   <br>     

<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
A seamless interpretation and analysis of Environmental Services (ES) data information across formats to assist users in near real-time condition monitoring of properties, improving service responses and optimising resource allocation translating to cost savings, improvement in productivity, service quality and performance.
