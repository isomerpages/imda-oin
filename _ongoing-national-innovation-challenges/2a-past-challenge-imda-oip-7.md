<br>
IMDA’s Open Innovation Platform (OIP) is a virtual crowd-sourcing platform that connects and matches real business challenges or digitalisation opportunities of Problem Owners to Problem Solvers. As part of the first call of National Innovation Challenges, IMDA OIP is hosting 4 challenge statements aimed at enabling key industries, such as construction, maritime, events and tourism, which drives Singapore's economy to emerge stronger from Covid-19.

    <label for="list-item-1" class="first">An Integrated Control System for Visitors and Exhibitors of Events to Facilitate Effective Screening, Contact Tracing and Crowd Density Detection</label>
        <ul>
          <li><b><h4>SACEOS</h4>How might we create an integrated control system for visitors and exhibitors of events to facilitate effective screening, contact tracing and crowd density detection, so as to ensure a safe environment that enhances the event experience?<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5></b>
A prototype solution to create a control system for event organisers that will facilitate safe entry, responsible interactions and fast incident response during and post events. This system could be a combination of software and hardware solutions and must take into consideration the seamless integration into the visitors’ experience. 
<br><br>
The system should make provision for – a seamless check-in module and a real-time crowd density detection module. As far as possible, the system should be designed such that it is able to integrate into current platforms that event organisers are already using. It should also be simple and easy to use, so as to encourage adoption among event participants. Proposed solution should address the data protection and anonymity when data collection is done. 
<h5>DEADLINE</h5>
All submissions must be made by <b>28 August 2020, 1600 hours (SGT/GMT +8)</b>. SACEOS and IMDA may extend the deadline of the submission at their discretion. Late submissions will not be considered.<br><br>

      <ul>
        <li><b><h4>Building and Construction Authority (BCA), KAJIMA Group</h4>How might we leverage a digital platform to facilitate an integrated management system of both worksite and workforce to ensure a Covid-safe work environment that will help the construction industry resume work with confidence, as well as mitigate both manpower and supply chain risks in order to secure business continuity in the future? <h5>What We Are Looking For</h5></b>
A prototype solution that fully integrates a workforce management platform with an operational planning platform to enable work continuity on the construction worksites: 
<br>
•	Workforce management platform:<br>
o	This platform should be able to provide a robust monitoring system both on-site and offsite to manage the workforce-readiness status and enable movement control on-site to minimise the risk exposure<br>
•	Operational planning platform:<br>
o	This platform should be able to utilise input based on workforce availability status, on-site supply status to aid construction work planning in situations where there are potential disruptions.
<h5>DEADLINE</h5>

      <ul>
        <li><b><h4>National Heritage Board (NHB)</h4></b>
        <b>How might we create an easy-to-use platform for people to remotely access and interact with, to have a compelling, emotionally engaging virtual experiences that can complement with the real-world experience?</b>
        <h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
A prototype of a virtual environment of any physical site, in this case, Kampong Glam precinct including the Malay Heritage Centre, that is enhanced with interesting engagement experiences for cultural and commercial consumption, enabled through 5G network technology. <br><br>

The solution should include the following capabilities:<br>
•	Navigation capabilities: It should offer a simulated, compelling on-site experience that makes a user feel like they are virtually exploring through the area. <br>
•	3D virtual environment: The user should be able to experience the heritage through the architecture and cultural sights of the precinct through a 3D replicate of the physical environment <br>
•	Creative storytelling and engagement: The solution should bring the experience of the precinct alive through creative storytelling methods. This could be in the form of interactive games, compelling walkthroughs, or other mediums suggested by the solution provider<br>
•	Enhanced live events functionality: The solution should offer the capabilities of transforming the 3D environment into an online event space. Corporate businesses, social groups or public agencies should be able to easily organise a virtual event and manage the logistics such as ticketing, attendance, scheduling and advertising with ease. <br>
•	Social interaction platform: The virtual experience should be enriched by an accompanying social experience. Users should be able to interact with fellow users exploring the virtual cultural precinct. They should also be able to interact in real time and talk to community members of the precinct such as the shop owners and tour guides.<br>
•	In-platform commercial activities: Users should be able to browse products and shop in participating stores in the precinct. This should be a seamless end-to-end transaction experience that includes a payment and delivery system. This solution could be via external links to the businesses own existing e-commerce platforms. <br>
•	Crowdsourced content creation: The solution should offer a way for businesses and users to create their own content in the platform. Users should be able to easily upload their content in pre-set formats that will allow for consistency in the quality of content. 

<h5>DEADLINE</h5>
All submissions must be made by <b>28 August 2020, 1600 hours (SGT/GMT +8)</b>. NHB and IMDA may extend the deadline of the submission at their discretion. Late submissions will not be considered.<br><br>

      <ul>
        <li><b><h4>PSA Singapore</h4></b>
        <b>How might we develop an integrated track and trace system for effective Covid risk control, mitigation and intervention, with minimal manpower for supervision?</b>
        <h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
PSA is seeking a prototype solution, demonstrating an effective system for managing the risk of coronavirus and other hazards for port workers within the port environment. The solution should include the following capabilities:<br><br>

•	Threat identification: Risk profiling of incoming ship’s crew based on manifest and other relevant data, which can be used to prevent exposure from shore-based workers, and to intervene early with quarantine, testing, treatment and other measures.<br>
•	Seamless access control: Temperature screening and identity verification at entry/exit points to the ports, and key gateways within the complex, to prevent access by those with self-declared high risk of exposure, evident symptoms, and to enable contact tracing after the fact. The entry/pass-through procedure should be as near seamless as possible, making use of existing access control infrastructure where possible.<br>
•	Wearable sensor: Using a wearable, ruggedized device, preferably built in to commonly used equipment (e.g. helmet), to track employee movement through access points and confirm identity. It must not interfere with work and suitable for rugged condition.<br>
•	Proactive risk profiling and screening: Use of all of the above data, as well as data from national track and trace schemes (under development) to determine worker infection exposure risk and proactively screen/quarantine higher risk workers. <br>
•	Workforce deployment and management: Use of above data, and integrating with workforce management systems, assist supervisors to determine best fit workforce deployments to the site (under conditions of split teams and physical distancing)<br>
•	Automated or remote monitoring of workers: both to assure physical distance and other personal safety behaviours are being maintained, and monitor work performance without the need for physical proximity. The monitoring solution is able to determine the location of the workers, and can detect where they are in close proximity to ship’s crew.<br><br>

The solution should be designed with the needs of the foreign worker in ports in mind (usability being paramount for a busy and harsh environment workforce).
<br><br>
There are no restrictions on the geographic location of the problem solvers who may choose to apply to this challenge. However, the prototype needs to be demonstrated in Singapore.
<h5>DEADLINE</h5>
All submissions must be made by <b>28 August 2020, 1600 hours (SGT/GMT +8)</b>. PSA and IMDA may extend the deadline of the submission at their discretion. Late submissions will not be considered.
