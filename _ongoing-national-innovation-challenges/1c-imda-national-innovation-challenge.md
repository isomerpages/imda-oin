The spread of Covid-19 has undoubtedly change the way that MICE events are organised. The introduction of social distancing measures, blanket regulation to cancel all mass gatherings and other necessary processes to ensure the safety of exhibitors and attendees, has negatively impacted MICE industry. Given how the MICE industry has always placed the safety and security of visitors, as well as the occupational safety and health of exhibitions during the planning and staging of events, it is imperative that the MICE industry is thus, given the security of planning to re-open in a phased manner, to reconnect and rebuild the businesses in this period of economic stagnation.

There is an urgent need to come up with solutions that place an over and above measures, that will allow MICE events to still carry on safely in a post Covid-19 world, taking into consideration the comfort and experience of the end user. In particular, being able to ensure a safe environment via a robust and seamless check-in process that facilitates information capture for future contact tracing, an integrated communications platform and a real-time density detection system, is key to build customer confidence and bring back international visitors. 

Exhibitions and events industry bring people together to do business. They are the marketplaces, the meeting places for entire industries – regionally, nationally, and internationally, to do business, build connections and grow sales channels. 

Thus, SACEOS is looking to quickly build and deploy a control platform that will address the key safety criteria for events to be trusted and held responsibly, thereby re-attracting visitors for tradeshows, conferences, business and consumer events. The platform should integrate a seamless screening process during check-in of registered guests with relevant data captured for future contact tracing and employ real-time density detection and alert features to ensure social-distancing is kept, so as to minimise crowding at hot spots, in particular at food lines, keynote halls, workshop areas, etc. It should also remove or minimise the burden of data protection and create a manipulation-proof list of participants, when required. 

In doing so, it hopes to position Singapore as a safe place to conduct business and build confidence in the local and international community to go for events in Singapore. It also hopes to spark a revival of the events industry and its value chain and potentially contribute to a common standard for MICE businesses to align to around safety regulations & best practices with regards to Covid-19.

This challenge is supported by SACEOS, the trade association of the meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) industry in Singapore. Its mission includes setting the direction for the growth and development of the MICE industry, promoting best practices and standards and enhancing the infrastructure and capabilities of the MICE industry in Singapore. The role of SACEOS in bringing together industry members to re-think how MICE events are conducted, is especially critical today as many MICE businesses look for solutions to adapt to a post Covid-19 world.

    <label for="list-item-1" class="first">How might we create an integrated control system for visitors and exhibitors of MICE events to facilitate effective screening, contact tracing and crowd density detection, so as to ensure a safe environment that enhances the event experience?</label>
    <ul>
      <li><h4>IMDA</h4><b>What We Are Looking For</b><br><br>
A prototype solution to create a control system for MICE event organisers that will facilitate safe entry, responsible interactions and fast incident response during and post events. This system could be a combination of software and hardware solutions and must take into consideration the seamless integration into the visitors’ experience. 
<br><br>
The system should make provision for – a seamless check-in module and a real-time crowd density detection module. As far as possible, the system should be designed such that it is able to integrate into current platforms that event organisers are already using. It should also be simple and easy to use, so as to encourage adoption among event participants. Proposed solution should address the data protection and anonymity when data collection is done. 
<br><br>
        <b>Check-in Module</b><br><br>
The check-in module aims to safely screen all participants at a MICE event, ensuring as much as possible that those who are present are well and do not carry the Corona virus or are symptomatic. The system should also facilitate the provision of necessary information to the relevant authorities to aid in contact tracing should the need arises. 
<br><br>
The solution should consider for the following factors in proposing the solution:<br>
•	Event organiser is able to monitor registration of all participants and cap and control attendance when necessary. The system should be able to generate a manipulation-proof list of participants, ensuring credibility of its data. <br>
•	Event organiser is able to set up external and internal checkpoints to manage flow and density of visitors. Besides controlling access at the entrance/exit, the system should also cater for check-in/ check/out functions at internal rooms and spaces.<br>
•	Event organiser is able to use the system for incident handling and reporting<br>
•	Event participant can register for an event online and seamlessly provide the necessary details for contact tracing purposes. At key pre-determined areas in the event space (E.g., workshop rooms), the system automatically detects when check-in and check-out happens. This data needs to be easily extractable and in a rapid way, to inform any action that is necessary. <br>
•	Event participants (visitor and exhibitor) receive guidance and assurance about control measures upon registration and are reminded during check-in.<br>
•	Push registration - log into the system

    <ul>
      <li><h4>  Dolor Sit Amet Pte Ltd (DSA Pte Ltd)</h4>A building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and[1] walls standing more or less permanently in one place, such as a house or factory.[1] Buildings come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, land prices, ground conditions, specific uses, and aesthetic reasons. To better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures.

Buildings serve several societal needs – primarily as shelter from weather, security, living space, privacy, to store belongings, and to comfortably live and work. A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the human habitat (a place of comfort and safety) and the outside (a place that at times may be harsh and harmful).

Ever since the first cave paintings, buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression. In recent years, interest in sustainable planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings.

    <label for="list-item-3" class="last">Reducing (Some problem statement) about Planes</label>
    <ul>
      <li><h4> Consectetur</h4>An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane) is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller or rocket engine. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research. Worldwide, commercial aviation transports more than four billion passengers annually on airliners[1] and transports more than 200 billion tonne-kilometers[2] of cargo annually, which is less than 1% of the world's cargo movement.[3] Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled such as drones.

The Wright brothers invented and flew the first airplane in 1903, recognized as "the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight".[4] They built on the works of George Cayley dating from 1799, when he set forth the concept of the modern airplane (and later built and flew models and successful passenger-carrying gliders).[5] Between 1867 and 1896, the German pioneer of human aviation Otto Lilienthal also studied heavier-than-air flight. Following its limited use in World War I, aircraft technology continued to develop. Airplanes had a presence in all the major battles of World War II. The first jet aircraft was the German Heinkel He 178 in 1939. The first jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet, was introduced in 1952. The Boeing 707, the first widely successful commercial jet, was in commercial service for more than 50 years, from 1958 to at least 2013.
