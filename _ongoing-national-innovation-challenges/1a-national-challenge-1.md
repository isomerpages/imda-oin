**Application Open Dates: 23 June 2020 to 03 August 2020**<br>

The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed businesses to pivot in order to adapt and evolve. Given the scale of infrastructure projects, the built environment industry is in a great position to tap on new solutions to transform. If you have fresh solutions to build smarter, faster and greener – JTC wants you!

Supported by Enterprise Singapore Gov-PACT and Open Innovation Network as part of the National Innovation Challenge, JTC aims to identify partners with the capability to develop new solutions that better address challenges in the built environment. Our objectives are to find solutions that let us build and operate sustainably, manage life cycle costing, and improve safety and productivity throughout the building life cycle.

Shortlisted projects get up to $250,000 in funding, and JTC will also provide domain expertise, and access to test-bed and pilot locations in selected JTC estates. Identified parties will work with JTC research engineers, operations specialists, and building and estate owners to co-create and co-develop these solutions. The developed solutions may also be adopted by other public agencies or corporate partners.

Through our support, companies can defray development costs, reduce business risk and bring ideas to market faster. 

<b>For 2020, JTC Innovation Challenge will focus on:</b>

<ul>
  <li>Automation and productivity, solutions that improve manpower productivity and reduce reliance on manual labour</li>
  <li>Digitalisation of the build environment, easing the transition into using Building Information Mangement (BIM) Models and developing BIM-based solutions that address construction painpoints</li>
  <li>Sustainability and resilience, to reduce our carbon impact on the environment and improve our resilience to supply chain disruptions</li>
</ul>

    <label for="list-item-1" class="first">Inspection for Estate Asset, Virtual InSpectIon which Omits Manual processes (V.I.S.I.O.N)</label>
        <ul>
          <li><b><h4>JTC Corporation (JTC)</h4></b>Estate inspection or fault identification currently requires manual scanning of assets conditions during drive through. The current inspection process is manual and laborious. When a fault is spotted, the officer has to look for a nearby safe spot to stop and park the vehicle before he/ she is able to conduct a more detailed assessment of the fault. After the drive through, the officer has to manually upload the photos, compile a report and send it to the respective coordinating agency. The process is time consuming and turnaround time to generate the report is rather long.
<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>

1. Viable solution that increases manpower productivity and safety – A solution that captures images/ shapes/ contours, identify and flag out fault conditions and automatically generating alerts and reports.<br>
2. Quick detection of faults and response time – The system shall reduce the reaction time between fault identification and rectification.

    <label for="list-item-2">Augmenting safety inspections for building and/or infrastructure construction sites</label>
      <ul>
        <li><b><h4>JTC Corporation (JTC)</h4></b>Noise restrictions, for workers’ welfare and nuisance control, limit the operating hours on a construction site. By exploring solutions that enable remote controlled or highly automated operations of various quiet construction tasks, construction can continue within the restricted noise levels after the traditional “noisy hours”. The construction site productivity can be improved without compromising worker welfare and affecting nearby users/residents.
          
          <h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
          
1. Construction site can continue to be productive afterhours while ensuring minimal noise and dust generation.<br>
2. Increase manpower productivity by at least 100% or reduce labour reliance by 50% during afterhours work at the construction site.<br>
3. Proposed solution is cost effective in comparison to conventional methods.<br>
4. Ensures safety of workers during the afterhours work.<br><br>

    <label for="list-item-3">Augmenting safety inspections for building and/or infrastructure construction sites</label>
      <ul>
        <li><b><h4>JTC Corporation (JTC)</h4></b>Construction industry is one of the most high-risk work environment, with higher fatality rate than most industries. According to the published Workplace Safety and Health Report from MOM, 13 workplace fatal injuries and 596 major injuries occurred in the Construction Industry in 2019.
          
          <h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
          
We envision an affordable cloud-based AI-enabled computer vision empowered cameras to identify and flag out potential safety hazards by providing predictive and timely alerts to the relevant construction sites’ stakeholders. The stakeholders would be able to assign the most appropriate response party to intervene and take appropriate actions to remove or mitigate the potential threats.
