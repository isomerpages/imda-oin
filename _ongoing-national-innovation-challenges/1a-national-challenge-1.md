**Application Open Dates: 23 June 2020 to 03 August 2020**<br>

The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed businesses to pivot in order to adapt and evolve. Given the scale of infrastructure projects, the built environment industry is in a great position to tap on new solutions to transform. If you have fresh solutions to build smarter, faster and greener – JTC wants you!

Supported by Enterprise Singapore Gov-PACT and Open Innovation Network as part of the National Innovation Challenge, JTC aims to identify partners with the capability to develop new solutions that better address challenges in the built environment. Our objectives are to find solutions that let us build and operate sustainably, manage life cycle costing, and improve safety and productivity throughout the building life cycle.

Shortlisted projects get up to $250,000 in funding, and JTC will also provide domain expertise, and access to test-bed and pilot locations in selected JTC estates. Identified parties will work with JTC research engineers, operations specialists, and building and estate owners to co-create and co-develop these solutions. The developed solutions may also be adopted by other public agencies or corporate partners.

Through our support, companies can defray development costs, reduce business risk and bring ideas to market faster. 

<b>For 2020, JTC Innovation Challenge will focus on:</b>

<ul>
  <li>Automation and productivity, solutions that improve manpower productivity and reduce reliance on manual labour</li>
  <li>Digitalisation of the build environment, easing the transition into using Building Information Mangement (BIM) Models and developing BIM-based solutions that address construction painpoints</li>
  <li>Sustainability and resilience, to reduce our carbon impact on the environment and improve our resilience to supply chain disruptions</li>
</ul>

    <label for="list-item-1" class="first">Inspection for Estate Asset, Virtual InSpectIon which Omits Manual processes (V.I.S.I.O.N)</label>
        <ul>
          <li><b><h4>JTC Corporation (JTC)</h4></b>Estate inspection or fault identification currently requires manual scanning of assets conditions during drive through. The current inspection process is manual and laborious. When a fault is spotted, the officer has to look for a nearby safe spot to stop and park the vehicle before he/ she is able to conduct a more detailed assessment of the fault. After the drive through, the officer has to manually upload the photos, compile a report and send it to the respective coordinating agency. The process is time consuming and turnaround time to generate the report is rather long.
<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>

1.Viable solution that increases manpower productivity and safety – A solution that captures images/ shapes/ contours, identify and flag out fault conditions and automatically generating alerts and reports.<br>
2.Quick detection of faults and response time – The system shall reduce the reaction time between fault identification and rectification.

A prototype solution that fully integrates a workforce management platform with an operational planning platform to enable work continuity on the construction worksites: 
<br>
•	Workforce management platform:<br>
o	This platform should be able to provide a robust monitoring system both on-site and offsite to manage the workforce-readiness status and enable movement control on-site to minimise the risk exposure<br>
•	Operational planning platform:<br>
o	This platform should be able to utilise input based on workforce availability status, on-site supply status to aid construction work planning in situations where there are potential disruptions.
