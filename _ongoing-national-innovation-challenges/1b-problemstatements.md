    <label for="list-item-1" class="first">Automated Inspection of Shipping Containers at Container Depots</label>
    <ul>
      <li>There are around 11 shipping container depot operators in Singapore, operating ~20 container depot yards. At each of these yards, the inspection of containers (20ft and 40ft) for defects is carried out manually by a surveyor, in accordance to standards such as the Technical Reference Standard 39 (TR39, developed by the Singapore Standards Council, Logistics Technical Committee), Cargo Worthy Standards by Shipping Lines or IICL Standards (Institute of International Container Lessors). Around 3 – 5 surveyors are deployed at each of the container inspection yard.<br><br>

Existing Process
On average, about 100 to 200 containers are inspected daily for defects or damages. Generally, about 30 to 40% of the containers are expected to have some form of defects or damages that should be detected and identified [Refer to supporting document for typical defects/damages].
<br><br>
The existing inspection process is a visual one, and the estimated time taken to inspect each container may range from 5-10 mins (no defects), 20 minutes (minor defects) and up to around 40 minutes (serious defects). Inspection is typically carried out in the day with containers mounted on trailers. As the inspection may include some work at heights, the appropriate safety considerations for fall prevention would have to be put in place.
<br><br>
Other challenges include inspection of the undersides of container surfaces which may be obscured from view unless the surveyor access from under the trailer chassis.
<br><br>
The solution sought should be able to inspect the container autonomously or remotely, effectively detect, assess and classify the defects on containers and tag the findings to the containers based on their identification numbers. Ideally, the number of surveyors required per inspection yard should be reduced to 1 – 2.
