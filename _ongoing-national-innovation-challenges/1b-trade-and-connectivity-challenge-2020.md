Into its second year, the Trade and Connectivity Challenge (TCC) 2020 connects startups with corporates to address challenges and showcase innovation in the aviation, maritime, land mobility, logistics and trade sectors. For this year’s TCC  several problem statements with wider industry relevance will be part of the newly launched National Innovation Challenges, which aims to help companies emerge stronger and address mid to longer term sectoral challenges in the post-COVID era.

    <input type="checkbox" id="list-item-1">
    <label for="list-item-1" class="first">Automated Inspection of Shipping Containers at Container Depots</label>
        <ul>
          <li><b><h4>Container Depot & Logistics Association of Singapore (CDAS)</h4>How might we reduce the time taken and the reliance on manual labour to improve productivity for the container inspection process and eliminate risky activities such as working at height?</b>
            <h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
The solution sought should be able to inspect the container autonomously or remotely, effectively detect, assess and classify the defects on containers and tag the findings to the containers based on their identification numbers. Ideally, the number of surveyors required per inspection yard should be reduced to 1 – 2.

    <label for="list-item-2">RFID Tagged Airfreight Shipments – Industry Use of RFID Printed Air Waybill (AWB) Label/Tags to Replace Normal Printed AWB Label</label>
      <ul>
        <li><b><h4>SATs Ltd</h4>
       How might we develop a cost-effective RFID tagging solution for the tracking and tracing of air cargo?</b>
        <h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
•	Outcome 1: To move Singapore airfreight industry towards a common AWB labelling standard with the use of RFID-embedded printed label or tag, and where the piece level of the cargo is also associated to a RFID-tagged unit load device (ULD).<br>
•	Outcome 2: To the shipper, GHA & carrier, provide visibility for track and trace of the shipment at every stage of the shipment including the handling in the warehouse, until uplift or arrival. The benefit of using RFID systems is that it does not rely on a line-of-sight to identify an item and hence the use of RFID readers will facilitate operational efficiency and replace manual scanning or manual recording of AWB. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has since announced in 2018 that all passenger bags must be tracked by RFID & airports must move towards implementation of RFID readers. This concept could be applied to air-cargo and Singapore airport can be the first mover with the joint-industry effort.
