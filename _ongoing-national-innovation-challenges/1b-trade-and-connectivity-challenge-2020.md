Into its second year, the Trade and Connectivity Challenge (TCC) 2020 connects startups with corporates to address challenges and showcase innovation in the aviation, maritime, land mobility, logistics and trade sectors. For this year’s TCC  several problem statements with wider industry relevance will be part of the newly launched National Innovation Challenges, which aims to help companies emerge stronger and address mid to longer term sectoral challenges in the post-COVID era.

    <label for="list-item-1" class="first">Automated Inspection of Shipping Containers at Container Depots</label>
        <ul>
          <li><b><h4>Container Depot & Logistics Association of Singapore (CDAS)</h4>How might we reduce the time taken and the reliance on manual labour to improve productivity for the container inspection process and eliminate risky activities such as working at height?</b>
            <h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
The solution sought should be able to inspect the container autonomously or remotely, effectively detect, assess and classify the defects on containers and tag the findings to the containers based on their identification numbers. Ideally, the number of surveyors required per inspection yard should be reduced to 1 – 2.

    <label for="list-item-2">Seeking Solutions for the Management and Dynamic Allocation of Resources in a Post-COVID 19 Work Setting</label>
      <ul>
        <li><b><h4>YCH Group</h4></b>
      The platform is envisaged to be powered by IoT devices and machine learning capabilities. It should be able to provide value through tracking, visualisation, analysis, prediction and optimisation.<br>
          <b>Interoperable Solutioning</b>: This solution should be able to integrate with our existing software solutions including enterprise resource planning (ERP) and warehouse management systems (WMS)<br>
          <b>Managing Staffing Requirements</b>: Our distribution centre has many customers from different sectors, hence there are different peak-season period where resources are not being fully maximised.<br><br>In a post-COVID world scenario, there has to be granularity of data to allow for a “safe” workplace. Tracking the location of the individual is desirable, not necessarily to an exact location, but to that of the floor level for example<br><br>
      
Possible methods of tracking include, but not limited to:<br>

• Wearables<Br>
• Computer Vision<br>

  

        <h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
•	Outcome 1: The solution we are seeking should be able to cater to the multiple skills possessed by our employees, and be able to optimally allocate resources to the task at hand, without overburdening the employee.<br>
•	Outcome 2: The solution should be able to track the utilisation of equipment, such as forklifts and reach trucks.<br>
      
Based on the data collected, the solution should be able to calculate the predicted level of productivity for each day, based on the number of employees available and their individual productivity level. Such calculations may be used to provide recommendations for optimal resource allocation, in fulfilling the total number of orders for the day.
The system should be able to calculate the gaps between order to fulfil and total predicted productivity. It should be able to recommend any additional manpower required to cover bottleneck activity and identify the suitable worker who is available and at the appropriate location to carry out the task.
<br><br>
Warehousing activities include:
•	Inbound – Unloading container<br>
•	Inbound – Receiving (gantry & scanner)<br>
•	Inbound – Put away (automated guided vehicle (AGV))<br>
•	Storage (automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS))<br>
•	Outbound – Process Order (WMS)<br>
•	Outbound – Staging (AGV)<br>
•	Outbound – Picking (robotic arms & scanner)<br>
•	Outbound – Shrink Wrap (wrapping machine)<br>
•	Outbound – Loading container
