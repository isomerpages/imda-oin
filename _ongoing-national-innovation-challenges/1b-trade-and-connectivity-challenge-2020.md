Into its second year, the Trade and Connectivity Challenge (TCC) 2020 connects startups with corporates to address challenges and showcase innovation in the aviation, maritime, land mobility, logistics and trade sectors. Several of this year's TCC problem statements with wider industry relevance will be part of the National Innovation Challenges, which aim to help companies emerge stronger and address mid- and long-term sectoral challenges in the post-COVID era.

    <label for="list-item-1" class="first">Automated Inspection of Shipping Containers at Container Depots</label>
        <ul>
          <li><b><h4>Container Depot & Logistics Association of Singapore (CDAS)</h4>How might we reduce the time taken and the reliance on manual labour to improve productivity for the container inspection process and eliminate risky activities such as working at height?</b>
            <h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
To develop an autonomous or remote inspection solution that can effectively detect, assess and classify defects on containers and tag findings to respective containers. The solution should improve container depots’ handling capacity. This will increase the sector’s productivity and reduce reliance on manual labour. Remote inspection capability will also make the sector more attractive to locals. The capability could be exported to other foreign container depots to improve productivity.

    <label for="list-item-2">Management and Dynamic Allocation of Resources in a Post-COVID 19 Work Setting</label>
      <ul>
        <li><b><h4>YCH Group</h4>
      How might we develop an effective, cost efficient and user-friendly resource management and planning solution which enables optimisation of productivity with regard to manpower and equipment utilisation? </b>
     
<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>

This solution should cater to post-COVID 19 work settings, where operations has to factor in Business Continuity Planning (BCP) requirements, social distancing and workforce segregation. 

The platform is envisaged to be powered by IoT devices and machine learning capabilities. It should be able to provide value through tracking, visualisation, analysis, prediction and optimisation.<br><br>
          <b>Interoperable Solutioning</b>: This solution should be able to integrate with our existing software solutions including enterprise resource planning (ERP) and warehouse management systems (WMS)<br><br>
          <b>Managing Staffing Requirements</b>: Our distribution centre has many customers from different sectors, hence there are different peak-season period where resources are not being fully maximised. In a post-COVID world scenario, there has to be granularity of data to allow for a “safe” workplace. Tracking the location of the individual is desirable, not necessarily to an exact location, but to that of the floor level for example.
