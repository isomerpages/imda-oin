IMDA’s Open Innovation Platform (OIP) is a virtual crowd-sourcing platform that connects and matches real business challenges or digitalisation opportunities of Problem Owners to Problem Solvers. As part of the second wave of National Innovation Challenges, IMDA OIP is hosting 3 challenge statements aimed at enabling key industries, such as aviation and built environment, which drives Singapore’s economy to emerge stronger from Covid-19.

    <h4> Challenge Statement(s) </h4>
<ul>
    <!-- start of drop down box 1 -->
  <li>
    <input type="checkbox" id="list-item-1" class="toggle">
    <label for="list-item-1" class="lbl-toggle">Effective Mitigation and Prevention of Covid Transmission on Flight</label>
      <ul>
        <li><b><h4>CAAS & SATS Ltd</h4>How do we restore the confidence that aircraft cabin has been effectively cleaned, disinfected on ground and while airborne?</b>

<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
A prototype solution that brings back confidence in air travel, either through the use of sanitisation technologies, or autonomous systems to that enables superior sanitisation and disinfection cleaning with  less manpower or higher efficiency, or any other digital means. The solution should not pose other health risks or compromise the customer experience.<br><br>
Compliance: It should meet international regulations, airline safety and health requirements, as well as manufacturer’s guidelines.

      <ul>
        <li><b><h4>CAAS & SATS Ltd</h4>How might we develop a threat detection solution through a networked X-ray machines that can automatically triage images from multiple machines, and securely be assessed by a centralised pool of certified operators for efficient and effective threat assessment?</b>
        
<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
        
A prototype solution that enhances their security screening operations, centralising screening review and risk assessment, thus driving efficient use of manpower.
<br><br>
There are no restrictions on the geographic location of the problem solvers who may choose to apply to this challenge. However, the prototype needs to be demonstrated in Singapore.
