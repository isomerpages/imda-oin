    <label for="list-item-2">Networked X-Ray Machines with Automated Risk Prioritisation for Centralised Control and Efficient Monitoring</label>
      <ul>
        <li><b><h4>Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Caas) & Sats Ltd</h4>How might we develop a threat detection solution through a networked X-ray machines that can automatically triage images from multiple machines, and securely be assessed by a centralised pool of certified operators for efficient and effective threat assessment?</b>
        
<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
        
A prototype solution that enhances their security screening operations, centralising screening review and risk assessment, thus driving efficient use of manpower. The solution should be able to perform the following functions:<br>
•	Connecting on-site screening stations to a central network: The solution must be able to securely connect the desktop computers attached to X-ray machines at each site to the central command. The connection can be via wireless or cabled connection, as long as it meets these criteria: <br>
o	Secure: The solution is required to meet the widely-accepted international security standards.<br>
o	Reliable: Must support 24/7 operation with an exceptionally high reliable signal quality<br>
o	Scalable: While the prototype will connect a small number (5) of machines around collocated SATS facilities, the commercialised solution should support eventual island-wide deployment in cost-effective manner.<br><br>

•	Image recognition and threat assessment: SSS requires an image recognition solution as part of the prototype, which will be trained (and continue to learn) as part of the prototype deployment. The solution must be able to recognise and prioritise potential threats (knives, firearms, incendiary or explosive devices) from the images produced by a scanner, that warrant closer inspection by a human operator (either due to an actual threat, or because the scan was inconclusive and needs rescanning).
<br><br>
•	Image triage and workflow management: Using the image recognition and threat assessment, the solution should intelligently select which images to prioritise for review by the centralised pool of certified operators. Where a surge of high risk images exceeds the capacity of the central capability, on-site staff need to be automatically instructed to slow scanning until the backlog has been cleared. 
<br><br>
•	Secure dual-way communication module: There must be support for voice communication between sites, to allow the centralised pool of certified operators to send instructions to the sites (and for clarification and questions from the sites). In addition, the solution should be able to send pre-programmed visual cues such as warning lights or red flags to prompt secondary scans, physical inspections, or even evacuations. SSS is open to utilising wearables or other means to make for a useful and seamless communication experience.
<br><br>
•	Image annotation: To further improve communication between sites, the central operator and the on-site operator should be able to view a shared image and annotate it with a stylus or similar.
<br><br>

<h5>Overall Performance Requirements</h5>
The problem solver should meet the following performance criteria in their proposal:<br>
•	Accuracy: Image recognition must be highly accurate to correctly identify and flag objects that pose potential security risks, or where a rescan may need to take place, meeting or exceeding the standards for certification of a trained operator.<br>
•	Speed: The transmission of image and communication network between the onsite screening stations and central review facility must be fast, in order to allow for real-time responses.<br>
•	Secure: The transmission between onsite screening stations to the central review facility should protect the data from third parties not authorised to receive.<br>
•	User-Friendly: It must be easy to use for both the onsite staff and the centralised pool of certified operators. <br>
•	Cost-Effective: The solution must demonstrate efficient use of manpower, thus resulting in cost-savings.<br><br>

There are no restrictions on the geographic location of the problem solvers who may choose to apply to this challenge. However, the prototype needs to be demonstrated in Singapore.

    <label for="list-item-3">Intelligent Site Inspection and Defects Management System 
</label>
      <ul>
        <li><b><h4>Building and Construction Authority(BCA) & Capitaland Limited</h4>How might we design a digital site inspection and defects management system in order to enhance the reliability and accuracy of defects identification, while minimising the need for large on-site stakeholders in a post-COVID-19 environment?</b>
        
<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
        
A prototype site inspection and defects management system with machine-learning and image-and-video analytics capabilities:<br>
•	Cost-effective – Solution should be cost-effective, easy to learn and adopt (through training and knowledge-sharing), so that it can be widely adopted across the sector by large and small subcontractors.<br>
•	Image and Video Analytics Capabilities – Solution should have robust image-and-video analytics capabilities to filter high volumes of video footage and flag out possible areas of defect. This would include a suite of camera systems with high mobility (or other video recording technology), that can be utilised in different scenarios as required for site inspections, especially for hard-to-access and dimly-lit areas. For example:<br>
•	Body-camera with flashlight for RTOs to capture images and videos during physical site-walks<br>
•	Camera drones with flashlight for aerial views of construction site, rises, facades, etc.<br>
•	Remote-controlled vehicles capable of traveling on rough construction terrains with attached camera and flashlights to enter tunnels, lift column or areas of the site where it may be unsafe or inaccessible for people<br>
•	Solution must allow for construction tolerance in its image-and-video analytics system <br>
•	Solution must process 2D and 3D drawings of the project, and cross-check on-site footage against drawings during various stages to identify possible areas of defects and create a list of preliminary warnings<br><br>
•	Data Aggregation – Solution must be able to consolidate unstructured data (video footage, images) and structured data (list of preliminary warnings and possible areas of defects) from different projects into a database, to allow for data transference across different projects and enhances the accuracy of defects identification through image-and-video analytics. Data should be owned by the Problem Owner and made easily available for transfer between cloud storages. <br>
•	Workflow Management – Solution should be able to share highlighted footage and list of preliminary warnings with multiple stakeholders in real-time. Solution must notify and tag key action owners and respective stakeholders to the list of preliminary warnings and possible areas of defects. The list of preliminary warnings and possible areas of defects would act as the first layer of inspection, thus allowing respective stakeholders to focus on these warnings and defects during on-site inspection, and streamlining the overall inspection process.<br>
•	Feedback System – Solution should have a feedback loop system to allow respective stakeholders and experts to verify and/or rectify different warnings and defects highlighted by the analytics. Coupled with the machine-learning capabilities, the solution should allow for the adaptive learning of the analytics system, to improve its accuracy in defects identification with each site inspection. Solution should allow users to include defects and feedbacks manually. <br>
•	Project Management – Solution must include project management and collaborative functions, such as file sharing, project and key issues tracking, assigning of tasks to respective stakeholders, progress tracking and reminders.<br>
•	Contractor Management – Based on historical data captured in the database, the solution should be able preliminarily assess and evaluate the suitability and capabilities of contractors and products across projects for benchmarking across projects and industry levels.<br>
•	Interoperable – Solution must have cross-platform interoperability and integration with existing construction-related software vendor systems, such as Novade, FinalCad, Aconex, TeamBinder, BIM Track and Navisworks, to work on 2D and 3D documents, and defects management, in a user-friendly way. Solution should have a mobile version to allow site inspection team to refer to possible areas of defects while on physical site-walks. Solution should take into consideration being flexible and modularised that can operate on a plug-and-play model.<br>
•	Naming Convention and Taxonomy – Solution should  standardise and reference to ISO/IEC and industry standards.
There are no restrictions on the geographical location of the problem solvers who may choose to apply to this challenge. However, the prototype must be demonstrated in Singapore.<br><br>
