The National Innovation Challenge (NIC) harnesses Singapore’s innovation capabilities to help businesses adapt to the New Normal. 
<br><br>
Building on existing innovation efforts from Enterprise Singapore’s Open Innovation Network (OIN), IMDA’s Open Innovation Platform (OIP) and the National Research Foundation, the NIC initiative provides support for the development, deployment and scaled adoption of solutions to address nationwide challenges, as well as medium- to long-term solutions for businesses to emerge stronger in the post-COVID environment.
<br><br>
NIC problem statements are a new category of open innovation challenges that focus on developing industry-led solutions to challenges that all businesses grapple with. Some starting areas of focus include how we can reopen Singapore safely – to achieve safe workplaces, homes, schools and commuting.
<br><br>
NIC provides a common open innovation platform for government agencies, Research Institutions, Trade Association & Chambers (TACS), corporates, SMEs and startups. Through NIC, enterprises, government agencies and industry associations can gain access to a diverse pool of solvers with cross-industry expertise, while our ICT solution providers receive support and funding required to develop and deploy their solutions into the market swiftly.
