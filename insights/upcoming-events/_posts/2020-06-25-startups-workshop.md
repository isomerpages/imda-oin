<h3>The CVC Way to Evaluating and Selecting the Right Startups</h3><br>


<p align="justify"><b>On June 25th at 9am (GMT +8), hear first hand from our 500 Startups' experts on how to evaluate and select startups.</b>

We will be sharing:

(1) Tips and advice on the 6Ts we at 500 apply when we evaluate startups to invest in, or to pick for our accelerator programs, and 

(2) How you too can use similar methods to conduct due diligence on startups who either want to partner with as a corporate innovation team, or invest in as a CVC.</p>
