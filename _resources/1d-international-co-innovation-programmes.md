In today’s age, innovation is the name of the game. But you don’t have to develop solutions in isolation. Singapore’s international co-innovation programmes will assist in your company’s growth and internationalisation, by supporting projects that catalyse cross-border collaboration on technology development and co-innovation.

These programmes open up new opportunities for the exchange of ideas and knowledge across enterprises in different countries. By working with an international counterpart, your company can co-innovate solutions, test-bed them and scale up into the region together.

As part of our expanding global network, we have set up partnerships with the [EUREKA Network](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/financial-assistance/grants/for-local-companies/international-co-innovation-programmes/eureka-global-stars-initiative){:target="_blank"}, [France](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/financial-assistance/grants/for-local-companies/international-co-innovation-programmes/singapore-france-joint-innovation-call){:target="_blank"}, [Germany](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/financial-assistance/grants/for-local-companies/international-co-innovation-programmes/germany-singapore-sme-funding-programme){:target="_blank"} and [Shanghai](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/financial-assistance/grants/for-local-companies/international-co-innovation-programmes/singapore-shanghai-joint-innovation-call){:target="_blank"}.
