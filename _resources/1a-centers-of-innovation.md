Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) looking to embark on technology innovation can tap on an array of ready resources available at one of the ten Centres of Innovation (COIs). From laboratory facilities to consultancy and training courses, you can receive assistance in developing and testing technology projects.

The ten centres are set up in partnership with selected polytechnics and research institutes. Each centre is a one-stop hub which specialises in a different industry. Together, the ten COIs cover aquaculture, energy, electronics, supply chain management, environment and water, food, marine and offshore, materials, and precision engineering industries.
