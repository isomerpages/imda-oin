In today’s age, innovation is the name of the game. But you don’t have to develop solutions in isolation. Singapore’s international co-innovation programmes will assist in your company’s growth and internationalisation, by supporting projects that catalyse cross-border collaboration on technology development and co-innovation.

These programmes open up new opportunities for the exchange of ideas and knowledge across enterprises in different countries. By working with an international counterpart, your company can co-innovate solutions, test-bed them and scale up into the region together.

As part of our expanding global network, we have set up partnerships with the EUREKA Network, France, Germany and Shanghai.
