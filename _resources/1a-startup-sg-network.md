Established in 2017, Startup SG was created to showcase Singapore’s vibrant startup ecosystem both locally and overseas. It represents the shared interests of the startup community and unifies efforts to support the ecosystem under its various initiatives and programmes. With Startup SG, startups and ecosystem partners can more easily discover and access available avenues of support.

In 2018, Startup SG Network was launched to bring Singapore’s tech startup ecosystem even closer together and encourage the proliferation of innovative and collaborative partnerships. A virtual ecosystem of entities in Singapore’s tech startup community, the platform allows local tech startups to profile and put themselves on the radars of both local and global ecosystem players, expanding their opportunities for growth.
