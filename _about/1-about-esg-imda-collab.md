#### Enterprise Singapore-IMDA Collaboration

Enterprise Singapore and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) are working together to develop a vibrant open innovation ecosystem in Singapore. Enterprise Singapore is the agency championing enterprise development from startups to SMEs and high-growth companies across all industry sectors. To do this, Enterprise Singapore works with committed companies to build capabilities, innovate and internationalise. IMDA leads Singapore’s digital transformation with infocomm media. To do this, IMDA will develop build a digital economy and robust infocomm media (ICM) ecosystem – by developing talent, strengthening business capabilities, and enhancing Singapore’s ICM infrastructure.

This collaboration leverages the strengths of both agencies to bridge the demand and supply channels of the innovation ecosystem, drive sectoral innovation and digitalisation, and position Singapore as a regional node for open innovation.
Both agencies will work to scale up IMDA’s Open Innovation Platform to cover sector-wide challenges for the first time, and plan to scale it regionally in the near future.
