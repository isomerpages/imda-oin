## **AN INTEGRATED CONTROL SYSTEM FOR VISITORS AND EXHIBITORS OF MICE EVENTS TO FACILITATE EFFECTIVE SCREENING, CONTACT TRACING AND CROWD DENSITY DETECTION**


#### **CONTEXT**
The spread of Covid-19 has undoubtedly change the way that MICE events are organised. The introduction of social distancing measures, blanket regulation to cancel all mass gatherings and other necessary processes to ensure the safety of exhibitors and attendees, has negatively impacted MICE industry. Given how the MICE industry has always placed the safety and security of visitors, as well as the occupational safety and health of exhibitions during the planning and staging of events, it is imperative that the MICE industry is thus, given the security of planning to re-open in a phased manner, to reconnect and rebuild the businesses in this period of economic stagnation.

There is an urgent need to come up with solutions that place an over and above measures, that will allow MICE events to still carry on safely in a post Covid-19 world, taking into consideration the comfort and experience of the end user. In particular, being able to ensure a safe environment via a robust and seamless check-in process that facilitates information capture for future contact tracing, an integrated communications platform and a real-time density detection system, is key to build customer confidence and bring back international visitors. 

Exhibitions and events industry bring people together to do business. They are the marketplaces, the meeting places for entire industries – regionally, nationally, and internationally, to do business, build connections and grow sales channels. 

Thus, SACEOS is looking to quickly build and deploy a control platform that will address the key safety criteria for events to be trusted and held responsibly, thereby re-attracting visitors for tradeshows, conferences, business and consumer events. The platform should integrate a seamless screening process during check-in of registered guests with relevant data captured for future contact tracing and employ real-time density detection and alert features to ensure social-distancing is kept, so as to minimise crowding at hot spots, in particular at food lines, keynote halls, workshop areas, etc. It should also remove or minimise the burden of data protection and create a manipulation-proof list of participants, when required. 

In doing so, it hopes to position Singapore as a safe place to conduct business and build confidence in the local and international community to go for events in Singapore. It also hopes to spark a revival of the events industry and its value chain and potentially contribute to a common standard for MICE businesses to align to around safety regulations & best practices with regards to Covid-19.

This challenge is supported by SACEOS, the trade association of the meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) industry in Singapore. Its mission includes setting the direction for the growth and development of the MICE industry, promoting best practices and standards and enhancing the infrastructure and capabilities of the MICE industry in Singapore. The role of SACEOS in bringing together industry members to re-think how MICE events are conducted, is especially critical today as many MICE businesses look for solutions to adapt to a post Covid-19 world. 


#### **PROBLEM STATEMENT**
How might we create an integrated control system for visitors and exhibitors of MICE events to facilitate effective screening, contact tracing and crowd density detection, so as to ensure a safe environment that enhances the event experience?

#### **WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR**
A prototype solution to create a control system for MICE event organisers that will facilitate safe entry, responsible interactions and fast incident response during and post events. This system could be a combination of software and hardware solutions and must take into consideration the seamless integration into the visitors’ experience. 

The system should make provision for – a seamless check-in module and a real-time crowd density detection module. As far as possible, the system should be designed such that it is able to integrate into current platforms that event organisers are already using. It should also be simple and easy to use, so as to encourage adoption among event participants. Proposed solution should address the data protection and anonymity when data collection is done. 

#### **Check-in Module**
The check-in module aims to safely screen all participants at a MICE event, ensuring as much as possible that those who are present are well and do not carry the Corona virus or are symptomatic. The system should also facilitate the provision of necessary information to the relevant authorities to aid in contact tracing should the need arises. 

The solution should consider for the following factors in proposing the solution:
•	Event organiser is able to monitor registration of all participants and cap and control attendance when necessary. The system should be able to generate a manipulation-proof list of participants, ensuring credibility of its data. 
•	Event organiser is able to set up external and internal checkpoints to manage flow and density of visitors. Besides controlling access at the entrance/exit, the system should also cater for check-in/ check/out functions at internal rooms and spaces.
•	Event organiser is able to use the system for incident handling and reporting
•	Event participant can register for an event online and seamlessly provide the necessary details for contact tracing purposes. At key pre-determined areas in the event space (E.g., workshop rooms), the system automatically detects when check-in and check-out happens. This data needs to be easily extractable and in a rapid way, to inform any action that is necessary. 
•	Event participants (visitor and exhibitor) receive guidance and assurance about control measures upon registration and are reminded during check-in.
•	Push registration - log into the system
 

#### **Real-time Density Detection Module**
The real-time density detection module works hand-in-hand with the check-in module to create a safe environment for visitors and exhibitors. It should be able to provide event organisers with an overview of the real-time situation on the ground and push selected information to visitors, empowering them to make decisions on where are the safe areas and which zones they should potentially avoid. 

The solution should consider for the following factors in proposing the solution:
•	The system is able to provide real-time headcount of pax in space (total numbers) and the overall density in specific areas
•	The system is able to identify hot-spots/ bottlenecks for rapid dispersal (breach detection)
•	The system has a function to alert event organisers when necessary to activate crowd dispersal measures. The preference if for crowd dispersal/ enforcement to be done through non-human means (e.g. a robot, or other measure that delivers reminders to consumer).
•	Upon entry of the event space, a visitor is able to choose where they want to go and which places to avoid based on the current crowd density. They do this by informed on their mobile devices where the “hot zones” are. The system has a function to communicate and alert visitors to avoid over-crowded areas and to move out of the “hot zones” if they are there.
•	The solution for managing crowds needs should take a 'nudge' approach, and not affect the customer experience by being too directive. 
•	The system should incorporate some form of visualisation dashboard to aid event organisers in having an overall picture of the situation and also a way for visitors to track where the hot spots and cool zones are.
 

#### **Overall Performance Requirements**
The problem solver should meet the following performance criteria in their proposal:
•	Data security is critical. The solution must protect personal data, and be trusted by people in Singapore, and internationally.
•	The solution should bring data together to give a strategic/ operation picture - creating a data sharing platform.
•	As far as possible the solution should integrate into other systems and digital platforms that event organisers and customers currently use. These include: 
-	Integration with gov systems (SafeEntry, TraceTogether etc.)
-	Integration with industry systems
-	Integration with common consumer products (e.g. WeChat)
-	Integration with event organisers' own app
•	The solution should be easy to use from a consumer perspective and simple to implement from the organiser’s end, so as to facilitate adoption.  
•	The solution may incorporate both hardware and software components but any hardware component should carry a light footprint. (Solution provider should also consider what's sitting at the entry/exit and what's sitting in other rooms.)
•	The solution should consider the overall visitor experience and be as non-intrusive as possible (e.g., no need for multiple check-ins at every different parts of the venue). It should be a platform that integrates the entire experience across the event period and allows for continued engagement options, without too many disruptions that would put off the participants.
•	The solution should incorporate data reconciliation, ensure that data captured is accurate and useful.
•	The solution should ensure effective tracing - complete tracing of one individual across multi-venue that is fast and accurate.
•	The solution should be scalable across different events format.
•	[Ability for modules extension] The solution should demonstrate potential to extent its functionalities to benefit MICE organisers, event partners, exhibitors, and other business stakeholders in the commercial aspects, e.g.  
-	Incorporating machine learning to analyse collected data with social media data to drive sales conversion & digital marketing
-	Integrate with chatbot or voicebot to improve visitor experience with some level of personalisation 
-	Support and integrate physical or virtual events with immersive technologies, such as AR/VR, mixed reality, etc.
There are no restrictions on the geographic location of the problem solvers who may choose to apply to this challenge. However, the prototype needs to be demonstrated in Singapore within three months. 

#### **POSSIBLE USE CASE**

On registration for an event, visitors and exhibitors are required to provide information that is required to facilitate effective contact tracing. This information is easily revised to include the latest updates in regulations and advisories.  Event visitors and exhibitors are also made aware of the measures that have been put in place to ensure their safety and what the important points they should take note for the event.
During the event, the check-in process screens off visitors who do not meet the safety criteria. This is done in an effective but non-intrusive way to maintain a pleasant customer experience. 
Upon entering the event space, visitors have access to an additional layer of information on crowd density that is integrated to the event app (no need to download an additional app). They are able to make intentional choices on where to go and which zones to avoid. They are alerted when they are within an over-crowded area and “nudged” to maintain safe social distancing. 
At the same time, event organisers have a real-time overview of the crowd density situation on the ground and are alerted whenever hot spots appear. They are able to take action and activate the necessary means to disperse crowds when required. This is done in a way that maintains a smooth and pleasant customer experience. 
Post event, information collected is held securely and rapidly made available to the authorities should contact tracing be required. There is also a way of contacting and informing international visitors who might have be affected.
