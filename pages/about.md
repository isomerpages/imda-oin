#### Open Innovation Network

The Open Innovation Network (OIN) is an initiative by ESG and IMDA to provide a single gateway to search and promote all open innovation challenges happening in Singapore. 

The OIN supports open innovation in Singapore by providing a one-stop directory of challenges and community partners. Startups or enterprises with an idea or technology can use the OIN to search for relevant challenges to participate in, and access co-development and test-bedding opportunities with major companies. Corporates and agencies with pain points can use our resources to embark on open innovation for the discovery of new ideas and solutions, or to connect with partners within the ecosystem.

With OIN, the future of open innovation in Singapore will be more extensive, collaborative and engaged with the regional and global open innovation community.
