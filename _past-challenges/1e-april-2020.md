Temasek Foundation is calling on individuals, groups, start-ups or companies, who are working on impactful and innovative technologies targeted at combating the COVID-19 virus or other infectious disease outbreaks, to submit their proposals for project development funding. This is a new call for proposals to support impactful and innovative technologies to be piloted or deployed within six months.
 
The proposals should significantly address prevention, treatment, testing and/or monitoring needs to combat infectious diseases (e.g. COVID-19). Some of the possible public health outcomes could include a significant reduction in healthcare costs and the suffering of those afflicted. We will be accepting these proposals from now until 30 April 2020.

For more information, please contact <tfecosperity@temasekfoundation.org.sg>.
