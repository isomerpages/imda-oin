**Application Open Dates: 15 September 2020 to 26 October 2020**<br>

<font color=" #a9a9a9"><b>Enterprise Singapore(ESG), JTC Corporation(JTC)</b></font>

The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed businesses to pivot in order to adapt and evolve. Given the scale of infrastructure projects, the built environment industry is in a great position to tap on new solutions to transform. If you have fresh solutions to build smarter, faster and greener – JTC wants you!

Supported by Enterprise Singapore Gov-PACT and Open Innovation Network as part of the National Innovation Challenge, JTC aims to identify partners with the capability to develop new solutions that better address challenges in the built environment. Our objectives are to find solutions that let us build and operate sustainably, manage life cycle costing, and improve safety and productivity throughout the building life cycle.

Shortlisted projects get up to $250,000 in funding, and JTC will also provide domain expertise, and access to test-bed and pilot locations in selected JTC estates. Identified parties will work with JTC research engineers, operations specialists, and building and estate owners to co-create and co-develop these solutions. The developed solutions may also be adopted by other public agencies or corporate partners.

Through our support, companies can defray development costs, reduce business risk and bring ideas to market faster. 

<b>For 2020, JTC Innovation Challenge will focus on:</b>

<ul>
  <li>Automation and productivity, solutions that improve manpower productivity and reduce reliance on manual labour</li>
  <li>Digitalisation of the build environment, easing the transition into using Building Information Mangement (BIM) Models and developing BIM-based solutions that address construction painpoints</li>
  <li>Sustainability and resilience, to reduce our carbon impact on the environment and improve our resilience to supply chain disruptions</li>
</ul>

<b>Sustainability and Resilience</b><br>

        <ul>
          <li><b><h4>JTC Corporation (JTC)</h4></b>JTC and Whole-of-Government (WOG) are deploying solar panels in suitable spaces in Singapore, hence with the wide-scale deployment, being able to detect defective panels effectively will allow JTC to ensure optimised renewable energy generation and minimise any risks from defective electronics.
<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
Technologies/systems that can accurately and quickly identify a variety of defects, such as hot spots, cracks or PID in solar plants, and flag out fault conditions and generate reports is a possible solution to mitigate such a challenge. The solution will shorten the time needed to identify problem areas in solar installations and enable solar plants to improve plant yield and increase safety of operation and maintenance.<br><br>

      <ul>
        <li><b><h4>JTC Corporation (JTC)</h4></b>Worldwide, construction booms in a thriving economy. The Global Status Report 2019 revealed that the building and construction together account for 39% of all carbon emissions in the world with 11% coming from embodied carbon. To decarbonise the sector, bold and innovative actions have to be taken.<br>
<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
We are seeking new materials for non-structural and structural applications that meet most, if not all, the following desired outcomes:
<br>
• Lower embodied carbon;<br>
• Improve construction productivity;<br>
• Reduce life cycle costing;<br>
• High possibility for wide-scale implementation<br><br>
