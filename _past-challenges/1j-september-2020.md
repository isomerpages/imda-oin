<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>

To develop a mobile optimised platform that consists of the following 2 portals:<br><br>
 
 <b>Portal 1: Learning Management System (For Residents)</b><br><br>
    <b>1.</b> To develop a series of self-assessment tools for residents to learn more about their health status i.e. psychosocial health, function and nutritional status. These comprise of questionnaires that will help them reflect on and evaluate their lifestyle, mood and social, Clinical Frailty Score and risk of falls, as well as nutritional awareness. The final assessment should also be made available to the residents.<br>
    <b>2.</b> To create an algorithm and a classification system to segment the residents based on their health status, then recommend suitable community programmes/services. This helps to educate and guide residents to appropriate resource(s) in the community that would help them better manage their health.<br>
    <b>3.</b> To incorporate quizzes that would help evaluate learning outcomes i.e. residents’ level of
understanding on their health status and the community resources.<br>
        <b>4.</b> To consolidate and organise existing community programme/services resources (LifeSG, Health Promotion Board Health Hub, ActiveSG, Agency for Integrated Care Silver Pages, Ministry of Social and Family development and National Silver Academy) into user friendly bite-sized modules so as to enhance residents’ understanding on the resources available in the community.<br>
        <b>5.</b> To include helplines, list of care providers, relevant announcement (e.g. screening events) and articles and a chat-bot function to facilitate information finding. Residents should also be able to identify and register for relevant programmes/services nearest to their home address.<br><br>


<b>Portal 2: Games module (For Residents and Staff)</b><br><br>
   <b>1.</b> To create game modules to (a) heighten staff’s understanding on importance of collaboration and shifting care into the community and (b) enhance residents’ competencies on the administration of self-assessment tools.<br>
    <b>2.</b> To address (a), there could be an overarching story- and choice-driven role playing game which focuses on elements of collaborations, joining up care, and the challenges faced by residents and providers. Key providers and services from Portal 1 should also be featured in the game to help players better draw relation to the real world.<br>
    <b>3.</b> To address (b), there could be a series of time pressure mini games which incorporate components from the assessment tools for residents to complete in order to assess their various health and social conditions. This could either be incorporated as part of (a) or exist as an independent module. The mini games should serve as an additional avenue to evaluate resident’s functional and cognitive ability e.g. Chair rise, walking speed, cognitive games etc. The scores from the games also serve as additional data points to assist the recommendation of programme in Portal 1. Interesting ‘Did you know’ messages should also be provided to educate the importance of maintaining a good state of functional and cognitive health.<br>
    <b>4.</b> The game modules should be easy to play and stop/pause, with simple controls and short tutorials. It should have outstanding presentation such as hand-drawn illustrations, minimalist graphics and a stylish user interface.<br>
    <b>5.</b> The game modules should illustrate strong synergy with Portal 1.

[![1](/images/ongoing-challenges/JTC-Innovation-Challenge.jpg)](https://gov-pact.ipi-singapore.org/grant-call/jtc-innovation-challenge)

**Application Open Dates: 04 August 2020 to 14 September 2020**<br>

<font color=" #a9a9a9"><b>Enterprise Singapore(ESG), JTC Corporation(JTC)</b></font>

The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed businesses to pivot in order to adapt and evolve. Given the scale of infrastructure projects, the built environment industry is in a great position to tap on new solutions to transform. If you have fresh solutions to build smarter, faster and greener – JTC wants you!

Supported by Enterprise Singapore Gov-PACT and Open Innovation Network as part of the National Innovation Challenge, JTC aims to identify partners with the capability to develop new solutions that better address challenges in the built environment. Our objectives are to find solutions that let us build and operate sustainably, manage life cycle costing, and improve safety and productivity throughout the building life cycle.

Shortlisted projects get up to $250,000 in funding, and JTC will also provide domain expertise, and access to test-bed and pilot locations in selected JTC estates. Identified parties will work with JTC research engineers, operations specialists, and building and estate owners to co-create and co-develop these solutions. The developed solutions may also be adopted by other public agencies or corporate partners.

Through our support, companies can defray development costs, reduce business risk and bring ideas to market faster. 

<b>For 2020, JTC Innovation Challenge will focus on:</b>

<ul>
  <li>Automation and productivity, solutions that improve manpower productivity and reduce reliance on manual labour</li>
  <li>Digitalisation of the build environment, easing the transition into using Building Information Mangement (BIM) Models and developing BIM-based solutions that address construction painpoints</li>
  <li>Sustainability and resilience, to reduce our carbon impact on the environment and improve our resilience to supply chain disruptions</li>
</ul>

<b>Digitalisation of the Build Environment</b><br>

        <ul>
          <li><b><h4>JTC Corporation (JTC)</h4></b>Some existing buildings drawings are missing or damaged. Most as-built drawings are also not updated. Using current reinstated method, staff must take measurement and determine the type of each item in the building or infrastructure, and manually update information in the drawing or 3D model. Although the use of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) may help to automate this process, manual tagging and identification of the object is still a required step. Both the manual measurement, and the scanning and tagging process are very laborious and time consuming.
<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
We envision a solution to identify, classify, and automatically convert elements from point cloud to 3D objects with tagged information. Flag up if the point cloud information is insufficient for the conversion process. The platform is to reduce the duration and resources required to digitise the existing buildings and infrastructure.<br><br>

    <label for="list-item-9">Automated Model Data Checking</label>
      <ul>
        <li><b><h4>JTC Corporation (JTC)</h4></b>A quality BIM model should be a large repository of data. Each object (e.g. doors, columns, chiller equipment) is a build-up of many aspects of information (e.g. properties, quantities, material, geometry, space and geo-reference) to allow them to be intuitive and useful. In a typical project, there can be hundreds of thousands of objects. This multiplies the volume of information in a BIM model. As a result, it is tedious to find and check the completeness and accuracy of the information for each and every object in the project.<br><br>

<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
1. A self-serviced, automated system for checking models based on JTC’s model data requirements.<br>
2. Self-serviced way for JTC to define our model data requirements and provide long term management of these data requirements so that they may be used to check models.<br>
3. Automated guidance to help BIM model authors enter data intuitively and in a standardized manner as they model.<br>
4. Ability to retrieve model information quickly and easily for verification and further analysis.<br>
5. Enable the BIM models as a data sources for other systems to make use of the BIM information submitted.<br><br>

      <ul>
        <li><b><h4>JTC Corporation (JTC)</h4></b>The BDRs’ rules could number up to several hundreds.

In order to check the adherence to these requirements, the human checker will need to keep in mind the huge pool of rules while navigating the entire development, from room to room, corner to corner. This process is tedious and rules are prone to
be missed in the process.

Being a repeatable task for large volume sets, this is an ideal task to be made automated.


<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
To have a self-service system to allow models to be checked automatically, reliably and accurately for non-compliances to JTC’s building design requirements.<br><br>
Designers and modellers can try checking at their own time and select the categories of rules they want to check whenever they complete parts of the model to find problems upfront. Issues found can be visualised for users to understand theunderlying reason of non-compliance without doubts. These issues can be automatically highlighted and tracked directly back in their native modelling software. <br><br>

Designers and modellers can be guided on a standardised way which is based on industry best practices as they model to smoothen the modelling and checking process. The modelling guides shall be intuitive and not overly onerous to suit checking.The system owner can continually create new rules and edit existing rules for long term maintenance. Through use of the system, the system owner can also retrieve information to perform targeted analysis by building elements and trend these information in a time series analysis.<br><br>

The system shall enable the submitted models as a data source for other systems to make use of the BIM information submitted.<br><br>
