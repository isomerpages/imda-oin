The initiative will focus on thematic areas, covering: (1) resource and value recovery from key waste streams, e.g. plastics, food, electrical and electronic products; (2) diversion of ash and residues to conserve landfill space; (3) environmental remediation of closed dumping ground and landfill; and (4) data and analytic driven waste management solutions.

In some of the world’s most vulnerable areas, the impact of COVID-19 could be catastrophic.
 
This extraordinary global situation demands a global response.
