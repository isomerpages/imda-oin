## FAQ 
#### **1.	What is the National Innovation Challenge? How does this differ to ESG’s open innovation challenges and IMDA’s Open Innovation Platform?**

The National Innovation Challenges (NIC) initiative aims to drive industry-led innovation calls to help companies address mid- to longer-term sectoral challenges and emerge stronger in the post-COVID era. To hasten the pace of innovation to commercialisation beyond the proof-of-concept stage, the government will provide support for prototype and product development, as well as incentivise demand-side stakeholders to accelerate deployment and scaled adoption. 

The NIC initiative builds on existing innovation efforts, such as Enterprise Singapore’s open innovation challenges, including Gov-PACT, and IMDA’s Open Innovation Platform (OIP).

#### **2.	What is the difference between OIN and OIP?**

Open Innovation Network (OIN) is an online directory that will serve as a national gateway to feature open innovation challenges happening island-wide.  This is jointly administered by Enterprise Singapore and IMDA. 

OIN aggregates all ongoing innovation calls launching in Singapore from existing open innovation challenge platforms in Singapore and features them on  the single interface. Through OIN, users will be re-directed to the host open innovation platforms where they can find more information about each specific innovation calls and how they can participate. Open Innovation Platform (OIP) is one of these platforms, led by IMDA. OIP’s fifth innovation call, with 35 problem statements with over S$1M prize monies, for example, is listed on OIN.

#### **3.	How frequent will the National Innovation Challenges (NIC) be called?**

NIC will be launched throughout the year, starting from July 2020. 

#### **4.	How would we measure the success of NIC?**

#### **5.	When will the challenges be launched, and when launched, how fast should the prototype, deployment and adoption be completed?**

The first six problem statements will span across the transport, logistics, built environment, MICE, arts & culture and maritime sectors, was launched on 22 July 2020. 

For the full list of problem statements, please visit xxxxx. 

Subsequent problem statements will be launched in the later part of 2020. 

#### **6.	How much funding will IMDA, ESG and NRF provide for each NIC stage?**

A total of $40m will be set aside for the NIC, and up to $2m will be allocated to support each challenge statement. The $2m will be split into $1m for Phase 1 (POC/prototyping) and Phase 2 (Deployment), and $1m for Phase 3 (Adoption). Co-funding of up to 70% will be provided for the three phases.

#### **7.	How can I access these problem statements?**

Enterprise Singapore and IMDA launched the Open Innovation Network last year, a national gateway to open innovation challenges, upcoming activities, latest happenings, and resources. Through OIN, interested parties can work together with other entrepreneurs, innovators, and researchers to address demand-led challenges that require collaboration in Singapore and beyond.

#### **8.	How will the government support deployment and adoption? What is the government doing differently from other innovation challenges? How much is the government spending to support this initiative?****

Building on past Open Innovation challenges, the NIC platform enables collaboration across government agencies, Research Institutions, Trade Association & Chambers (TACs), corporates, SMEs and startups to co-innovate and tackle industry-wide challenges. The industry involvement in problem ownership and crowdsourcing approach will help quicken the pace of innovation, commercialisation and adoption of solutions. The three agencies will also be providing S$40M in funding and research support to quicken industry deployment and adoption.

#### **9.	How different is NIC from the current innovation challenges that ESG supports through Gov-PACT? Is the funding via Gov-PACT?**


#### **10.	How many challenges have Gov-PACT supported so far and what are the results?**

For problem owners and solution providers
#### **11.	Are there any broad areas that the NIC is targeting to address? What if the problem is specific to my agency?**

The National Innovation Challenges (NIC) initiative aims to drive industry-led innovation calls to help companies address mid- to longer-term sectoral challenges and emerge stronger in the post-COVID era.

The NIC seeks to address challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The short term focus will target challenges of safe reopening, while the medium-to-long term focus seeks to tackle the new operating paradigms of the post-COVID-19 “new normal”, and solutions that will allow Singapore to take advantage of new opportunities and emerge stronger.

The NIC is open to all agencies and enterprises to participate as Problem Owners. However, the problem statement will need to meet the NIC criteria. If not, Problem Owners can still submit problem statements in the existing OIP categories. However, these will not receive additional funding and support for deployment and adoption.

#### **12.	What is the difference between digital and non-digital challenges?**

 “Digital Challenges” are challenges that source for digital solutions to address the problem statements. “Non-digital Challenges” involves technologies beyond digital development and are typically more complex as they may require additional knowledge in areas such as hardware design, materials applications, energy transmission/storage, etc. All NIC interest will be centrally managed and the team will channel the interests/challenges for follow up accordingly.

#### **13.	Are there any resources to guide a Problem Owner to launch an open innovation challenge?**

The NIC team will guide the Problem Owners throughout the innovation journey, from providing resources such as problem framing and refinement support, assisting in joint proposal filtering/assessment, marketing activities to drive proposal submissions to actively curate potential solvers through our networks. 

#### **14.	Who owns the solution IP?**

Problem Owner can reflect their preferred IP arrangement for the specific challenge.

In cases where the solution has nationwide impact, we recommend that the Problem Owner can own the IP, but publicly share it by making it almost free to use. In other cases, the IP can be owned by the solution provider. 

#### **15.	Whose onus is it to check that solutions do not infringe on existing IPs?**

It will depend on whether Problem Owner is the IP owner. If the Problem Owner owns the IP, then it is their responsibility to ensure that there is no infringement, to the extent that they are able to do so.

If the Problem Owner is only acting as the customer, and the IP is owned by the problem solver, then it becomes a commercial dispute between the problem solver and existing IP owner.

#### **16.	Is there any limit to the number of problem statements we can submit?**

There are no limits to the number of problem statements you can submit. We will prioritise problem statements for each call based on readiness for publication and impact.

#### **17.	What happens if two or more Problem Owners have a common interest in a problem statement?**

We encourage Problem Owners to submit problem statements even if they are “generic” or sector-agnostic. Where there is overlapping interest, we will engage agencies on the feasibility of putting out a joint problem statement, to generate greater interest and promote nationwide deployment.

#### **18.	How will problem owners’ expectations be communicated to potential solution providers? Will IMDA facilitate sharing sessions?**

We encourage Problem Owners to clearly state the problem statement and requirements as part of the challenge. IMDA will also facilitate meetings between Problem Owners and interested problem solvers to clarify expectations.

#### **19.	Who sieves through the problem statements to see if off-the-shelf solutions are already available?**

The NIC team will assess the draft problem statements to see if solutions are already available for the problem. 

For interested government agencies
#### **20.	Could I tap into the outcome-based procurement approach to host the challenge and support through to commercialisation?**

Yes. Outcome-based procurement can be used to procure emerging and innovative solutions through crowd-sourcing and an integrated procurement process, which allows Agencies to support POC through to full deployment without calling for additional tenders. IMDA Open Innovation Platform and ESG Gov-PACT programme are channels that support the outcome-based procurement approach.

#### **21.	What is the budget commitment for agencies participating in the NIC, and who provides the prize money / funding?**

The NIC provides funding for development, deployment and adoption for solutions, so that individual customers are more willing and able to adopt. We do not expect agencies to roll out solutions, but to work with IMDA and ESG to drive adoption throughout the industry. For more expensive solutions, or solutions where agencies have their own existing funds, we can explore co-funding solutions so that we can stretch the dollar further.

#### **22.	If the agency wants to deploy a solution for its own needs, how can we push out large-scale deployment without contravening procurement rules?**

MOF currently allows agencies to use spiral contracting, which allows projects to proceed in stages. There is no need for agencies to call for a tender to development the prototype or for pilot deployment as the NIC already has elements of open procurement with clear and objective outcomes. The NIC will also provide funding for the development and prototyping phase.

For deployment, agencies can then go through their own procurement process to purchase the solution, using their own funds.
