## Vision
To be the trusted partner for assurance of quality products and services locally and globally

## Misson
To deliver a robust accreditation framework and international recognition of Singapore-based enterprises

## Strategic Outcomes
SAC's focus areas include strengthening accreditation services by developing new accreditation programmes for emerging areas and administering the various accreditation schemes and registration programme under its umbrella. SAC strives to increase the adoption and conversion of accredited TIC services through regular engagements with the public agencies and major procurers. Through accreditation, SAC recognises, maintains and improves the standard of conformity assessment activities in Singapore. It also forges Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRAs) with regional and international bodies to facilitate trade for Singapore.

## Impartiality Policy
SAC is committed to safeguarding and assuring the impartiality of its accreditation activities at strategic and operational levels. SAC will not allow commercial, financial and other pressures to compromise impartiality. SAC ensures its committees operate with balanced views and representations from key stakeholders and interested parties, without permitting any one interest to predominate or receive favour.

## Financing
SAC is a not-for-profit establishment. SAC's main source of revenue is from fees collected from conformity assessment bodies as well as its training activities. Any deficit of SAC will be funded through Enterprise Singapore.
