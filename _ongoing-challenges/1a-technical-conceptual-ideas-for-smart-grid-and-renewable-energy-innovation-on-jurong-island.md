JTC has launched an Request for Information (RFI) for technical/conceptual ideas for smart grid and renewable energy innovation on Jurong Island on 30 April 2020. This RFI invites the submission of proposals and innovative ideas to:

(a)	Maximise solar deployment on Jurong Island (JI) and explore creative deployment of Energy Storage Systems;

(b)	Pilot and subsequently develop and operate a JI-wide smart grid management system or network of smart grid management systems, to coordinate conventional and renewable energy sources across JI to optimise energy supply and demand; and

(c)	Test-bed innovative low-carbon technologies and other renewable technologies (e.g. tidal), to further reduce JIâ€™s carbon footprint.
