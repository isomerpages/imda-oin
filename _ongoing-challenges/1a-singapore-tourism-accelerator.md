The STA is looking for the very best in innovation and are particularly interested in companies that are developing solutions to future-proof the travel and tourism industry and help tourism companies thrive in the new normal brought about by COVID-19. Whether you already have some traction in the industry, or are looking to apply your solution to the industry for the first time, we want to hear from you.

The 12 selected companies will gain unparalleled access to work with some of Asia’s and the world’s most important industry players. They will undergo a three-month intensive accelerator programme identifying a potential pilot project and scope, followed by three months of pilot implementation with selected industry partners for the top 10 companies. The accelerator entails an intensive programme to learn critical market entry skills, pilot design and implementation skills, building a company and culture that scales and fundraising strategies via workshops, 1:1 mentoring, peer learning, expert feedback, networking sessions with founders and investors, and industry events. The 6-month programme will end with a Demo Day with industry partners and investors.

During pilot implementation, the top 10 companies will receive funding support of up to 70% of qualifying costs, up to SGD25,000 per company to testbed their solutions.

All companies will receive a monthly stipend of SGD2,000 per company for the duration of their physical participation* in the programme, as well as assistance with temporary relocation (co-living and entrepreneurs' visa) to Singapore.

*As soon as the travel restrictions lift and entrepreneurs are able to base themselves in Singapore, they will be able to collect the monthly stipend.
