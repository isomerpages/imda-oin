The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed businesses to pivot in order to adapt and evolve. Given the scale of infrastructure projects, the built environment industry is in a great position to tap on new solutions to transform. If you have fresh solutions to build smarter, faster and greener – JTC wants you!

Supported by Enterprise Singapore Gov-PACT and Open Innovation Network as part of the National Innovation Challenge, JTC aims to identify partners with the capability to develop new solutions that better address challenges in the built environment. Our objectives are to find solutions that let us build and operate sustainably, manage life cycle costing, and improve safety and productivity throughout the building life cycle.

Shortlisted projects get up to $250,000 in funding, and JTC will also provide domain expertise, and access to test-bed and pilot locations in selected JTC estates. Identified parties will work with JTC research engineers, operations specialists, and building and estate owners to co-create and co-develop these solutions. The developed solutions may also be adopted by other public agencies or corporate partners.

Through our support, companies can defray development costs, reduce business risk and bring ideas to market faster. 

<b>For 2020, JTC Innovation Challenge will focus on:</b>

<ul>
  <li>Automation and productivity, solutions that improve manpower productivity and reduce reliance on manual labour</li>
  <li>Digitalisation of the build environment, easing the transition into using Building Information Mangement (BIM) Models and developing BIM-based solutions that address construction painpoints</li>
  <li>Sustainability and resilience, to reduce our carbon impact on the environment and improve our resilience to supply chain disruptions</li>
</ul>
 
<b>Digitalisation of the Build Environment</b><br>

        <ul>
          <li><b><h4>JTC Corporation (JTC)</h4></b>Some existing buildings drawings are missing or damaged. Most as-built drawings are also not updated. Using current reinstated method, staff must take measurement and determine the type of each item in the building or infrastructure, and manually update information in the drawing or 3D model. Although the use of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) may help to automate this process, manual tagging and identification of the object is still a required step. Both the manual measurement, and the scanning and tagging process are very laborious and time consuming.
<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
We envision a solution to identify, classify, and automatically convert elements from point cloud to 3D objects with tagged information. Flag up if the point cloud information is insufficient for the conversion process. The platform is to reduce the duration and resources required to digitise the existing buildings and infrastructure.<br><br>

    <label for="list-item-2">Automated Model Data Checking</label>
      <ul>
        <li><b><h4>JTC Corporation (JTC)</h4></b>A quality BIM model should be a large repository of data. Each object (e.g. doors, columns, chiller equipment) is a build-up of many aspects of information (e.g. properties, quantities, material, geometry, space and geo-reference) to allow them to be intuitive and useful. In a typical project, there can be hundreds of thousands of objects. This multiplies the volume of information in a BIM model. As a result, it is tedious to find and check the completeness and accuracy of the information for each and every object in the project.

In addition, the way models can be created are very flexible. For instance, a floor can be modelled simply as a concrete slab. A concrete slab may also represent a roof, a ramp or a ceiling. Information beyond just the physical aspects of the objects such as their purpose may not be interpreted consistently. To compound this further, even if the purpose are clear, the way
they are named may cause problems. For instance, a toilet may also be named as washroom, water closet, lavatory and toilette. This greatly hampers the ability to find and analyse the objects.
<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
1. A self-serviced, automated system for checking models based on JTC’s model data requirements.<br>
2. Self-serviced way for JTC to define our model data requirements and provide long term management of these data requirements so that they may be used to check models.<br>
3. Automated guidance to help BIM model authors enter data intuitively and in a standardized manner as they model.<br>
4. Ability to retrieve model information quickly and easily for verification and further analysis.<br>
5. Enable the BIM models as a data sources for other systems to make use of the BIM information submitted.<br><br>

    <label for="list-item-3">Automated Model Design Checker</label>
      <ul>
        <li><b><h4>JTC Corporation (JTC)</h4></b>The BDRs’ rules could number up to several hundreds.

In order to check the adherence to these requirements, the human checker will need to keep in mind the huge pool of rules while navigating the entire development, from room to room, corner to corner. This process is tedious and rules are prone to
be missed in the process.

Being a repeatable task for large volume sets, this is an ideal task to be made automated.

However, in contrast to checking of data which are text-oriented, majority of design checks are geometric in nature and require geometric methods to check accurately. For instance, a check of building height (a critical rule for aviation) is
more accurate when geometrically evaluated instead of merely reading off a height value which can be entered manually and not updated subsequently. At present, geometric methodologies applied to building requirements checking are lacking.

In addition, building requirements are in human language and open to misinterpretation. It requires further clarifications, or codification, for them to be turned into computer logic and enable rule based checks to be combined with geometric methods. (e.g. In order to check a rule to “provide sufficient airflow for a particular space” may be to find the percentage of openings for that space).

As with model data checks, while models can be worked on by different disciplines in parallel before being combined in a centralised model to increase productivity, the way the same objects and spaces are modelled are not standardized varying
from modeller to modeller. This makes identification of objects to be checked more difficult.
<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
To have a self-service system to allow models to be checked automatically, reliably and accurately for non-compliances to JTC’s building design requirements.<br><br>
Designers and modellers can try checking at their own time and select the categories of rules they want to check whenever they complete parts of the model to find problems upfront. Issues found can be visualised for users to understand theunderlying reason of non-compliance without doubts. These issues can be automatically highlighted and tracked directly back in their native modelling software.<br>

Designers and modellers can be guided on a standardised way which is based on industry best practices as they model to smoothen the modelling and checking process. The modelling guides shall be intuitive and not overly onerous to suit checking.<br>

The system owner can continually create new rules and edit existing rules for long term maintenance.<br>

Through use of the system, the system owner can also retrieve information to perform targeted analysis by building elements and trend these information in a time series analysis.<br>

The system shall enable the submitted models as a data source for other systems to make use of the BIM information submitted.<br><br>

      <ul>
        <li><b><h4>JTC Corporation (JTC)</h4></b>Quantification of actual site situation lacks accuracy due to the discrepancies between the documents submitted by the various parties and the actual site installation. There is no common platform to validate the actual site progress status. Currently, actual site progress status and update to the system is done manually which is very time consuming and labour intensive.
<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
We envision a solution to capture 360 photos and point cloud data to quantify the site progress automatically. A common platform to update, view and validate the site progress data and extract the site progress report from the platform automatically.<br><br>
