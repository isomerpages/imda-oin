In its second year, TCC 2020 is back to drive innovative partnerships to address challenges across the aviation, maritime, land mobility, logistics and trade sectors. This year’s competition is expanded to feature two challenge tracks, [Enterprise](https://tcc-enterprise.innovation-challenge.sg) and [Industry](https://tcc-industry.innovation-challenge.sg) (part of [National Innovation Challenge](https://www.openinnovationnetwork.sg/national-innovation-challenges/)). The Enterprise track calls for local and international startups to co-develop and test-bed innovative solutions with challenge sponsors through a paid contract during the trial stage. 

The challenge winner will stand to win the top prize of up to S$30,000 grant and will also advance into SLINGSHOT 2020 – Asia’s premier deep tech startup competition. Promising startups may receive additional funding support for project trials and an opportunity to further develop solutions with challenge sponsors.
