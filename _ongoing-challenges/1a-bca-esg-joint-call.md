**Application Open Dates: 01 August 2020 to 15 September 2020**<br>
<font color=" #a9a9a9"><b>Building and Construction Authority (BCA), Enterprise Singapore (ESG)</b></font>
<h4>Background</h4>

Guided by the long-term goal of Super Low Energy (SLE) buildings for the tropics, the Green Buildings Innovation Cluster (GBIC) was set up with funding support from National Research Foundation (NRF) to experiment, exhibit and exchange knowledge of promising building energy efficient solutions with industry stakeholders.


Following up from the success of the inaugural Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and Keppel Land Ltd (KLL) Joint Challenge Call to test-bed sustainable technologies at the Keppel Bay Tower, and the recent BCA-DBS Joint Challenge Call, BCA is collaborating with Enterprise Singapore (ESG) to launch the 3rd Joint Challenge Call to demonstrate innovative energy efficient solutions for a selection of 3 building projects.

<h4>Objective</h4>

As in the earlier editions, the Challenge Call provides building owners and developers with the opportunity to solicit suitable technologies and solutions that can help them to achieve SLE building by meeting the energy savings targets through the deployment of these technologies and solutions.  The 3rd Joint Challenge Call will consider an expanded scope of solutions for building sustainability and performance, including support for technologies to improve water efficiency and enhance indoor air quality.  In addition, greater emphasis will be placed on supporting technologies sourced from Singapore enterprises as aligned with the goals of Singapore’s Construction Industry Transformation Map.

<h4>Scope of Challenge Call</h4>

The 3rd Joint Challenge Call seeks proposals that include innovative emerging technologies to reduce the building’s energy consumption (e.g. façade, chillers, AHUs, BIPV, energy management systems, etc.), as well as solutions that will reduce occupant’s energy usage (e.g. lightings, plug loads, etc.) beyond Green Mark Platinum Standard.

<h4>Application</h4>

A webinar is planned for 12 August 2020 (Wednesday) 1500-1700hrs Singapore time. Hosted by BCA, ESG and the respective project owners, this webinar aims to provide a background on the building projects, what is expected of the challenge call and to address questions from participants. Interested participants may register for the webinar at [https://gems.gevme.com/bca-esg-challenge-call-launch](https://gems.gevme.com/bca-esg-challenge-call-launch). The link will be provided to you upon registration.

All proposals would have to be completed using the prescribed Annex A template and submit them via email to <a style="text-decoration: none" href = "mailto: BCA_Challenge_Call@bca.gov.sg">BCA_Challenge_Call@bca.gov.sg</a> by 15 Sep 2020, 1700hrs.
