**Application Open Dates: 01 August 2020 to 15 September 2020**<br>
<font color=" #a9a9a9"><b>Building and Construction Authority (BCA), Enterprise Singapore (ESG)</b></font>
<h4>Background</h4>

Guided by the long-term goal of Super Low Energy (SLE) buildings for the tropics, the Green Buildings Innovation Cluster (GBIC) was set up with funding support from National Research Foundation (NRF) to experiment, exhibit and exchange knowledge of promising building energy efficient solutions with industry stakeholders.


Following up from the success of the inaugural Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and Keppel Land Ltd (KLL) Joint Challenge Call to test-bed sustainable technologies at the Keppel Bay Tower, and the recent BCA-DBS Joint Challenge Call, BCA is collaborating with Enterprise Singapore (ESG) to launch the 3rd Joint Challenge Call to demonstrate innovative energy efficient solutions for a selection of 3 building projects.

<h4>Objective</h4>

As in the earlier editions, the Challenge Call provides building owners and developers with the opportunity to solicit suitable technologies and solutions that can help them to achieve SLE building by meeting the energy savings targets through the deployment of these technologies and solutions.  The 3rd Joint Challenge Call will consider an expanded scope of solutions for building sustainability and performance, including support for technologies to improve water efficiency and enhance indoor air quality.  In addition, greater emphasis will be placed on supporting technologies sourced from Singapore enterprises as aligned with the goals of Singapore’s Construction Industry Transformation Map.

<h4>Scope of Challenge Call</h4>

The 3rd Joint Challenge Call seeks proposals that include innovative emerging technologies to reduce the building’s energy consumption (e.g. façade, chillers, AHUs, BIPV, energy management systems, etc.), as well as solutions that will reduce occupant’s energy usage (e.g. lightings, plug loads, etc.) beyond Green Mark Platinum Standard.

<h4>Application</h4>

A webinar is planned for 12 August 2020 (Wednesday) 1500-1700hrs Singapore time. Hosted by BCA, ESG and the respective project owners, this webinar aims to provide a background on the building projects, what is expected of the challenge call and to address questions from participants. Interested participants may register for the webinar at [https://gems.gevme.com/bca-esg-challenge-call-launch](https://gems.gevme.com/bca-esg-challenge-call-launch). The link will be provided to you upon registration.

All proposals would have to be completed using the prescribed Annex A template and submit them via email to <a style="text-decoration: none" href = "mailto: BCA_Challenge_Call@bca.gov.sg">BCA_Challenge_Call@bca.gov.sg</a> by 15 Sep 2020, 1700hrs.   

You may also write to this email if you have any queries on the Joint Challenge Call.

<ul>
  <li>
    <input type="checkbox" id="list-item-1">
    <label for="list-item-1" class="first">To propose advanced technological solutions for St James Power Station (SJPS), a
monument building and achieve an EUI of 79 kWh/sqm/yr or below</label>
        <ul>
          <li><b><h4>Mapletree</h4></b>
            <h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>
Area for demonstration:
- Carpark is 1,522 sqm and it has 2 Jet fans.
- Landlord lighting power density is below 5 w/sqm.
- Heritage building compliance requirement poses challenge to improve ETTV
- Landlord is exploring Data analytics for Chillers and ACMV system to target
additional annual energy reduction 3 to 6%
            
Additional Notes:
a) EUI: 128 kWh/sqm/yr is based on estimated energy submitted for GM Platinum
certification under GM ENRB 2017
b) EUI: 79 kWh/sqm/yr is based on BEBR 2019 report for top 10% for 2018 for
Small Office Building category (Small: Office, Retail, Mixed Developments of GFA
<15,000 m²)
c) EEI: 70 kWh/sm/yr for tenants’ energy consumption as per GM HW 2018
Platinum certification.
d) St James Power Station is a gazette monument building and therefore have more
restrictions and challenges.

<h5>What We Are Looking For</h5>

<b>Description of building systems</b>:<br><br>
The cooling system in the building are combination of VRV system, which has multiple
indoor fan coil units connected to one outdoor unit. Each indoor fan coil unit has its
own metering device that is controlled by the indoor unit itself, or by the outdoor unit.
Other system includes ceiling fans and HVLS fans.<br><br>
A significant reduction in energy consumption in standard energy management cannot
be accomplished in a short time frame with the introduction of renewable sources of
energy alone. A synergistic approach and strategy must be undertaken, which also
includes increased efficiency of equipment, processes and practices used in the
energy management system. <br><br>

<b>Key to recognizing energy inefficiency is</b>:<br><br>
1) Increasing awareness of the urgency to undertake improvements in energy
conservation initiatives, continue to increase awareness and education
concerning methods of making significant improvements in energy efficiency.<br><br>
2) Using AI and Blockchain Energy Assessment software to help an energy
audit programme that analyses energy use for specific technology and identifies
areas where efficiency improvements can be made with projections of amounts
of energy saved along with costs of implementing the changes and pay-back
projections.<br><br>
3) Leveraging on integrated solutions comprised of both ours and international
technology/saving devices that contributed to an increase in cost savings and
reduction of losses.<br><br>
4) The long-term objective of such a programme is to develop a comprehensive
energy audit program that can be applied to all types of building operations in
Singapore.<br><br>
<b>Area for demonstration</b>:<br><br>
A. The area needed will be the rooftop and carpark for Solar installation.<br><br>
B. A selected area of probably 4 sqm to install a voltage stabilizer.<br><br>
C. An area to introduce high efficient package air-con in lieu of the current air
con along with particulate inducer to improve the efficiency of the air-con.<br><br>
D. Installing IOTs at selected equipment to achieve a mini BMS system for the
mosque.<br><br>
E. Particulate inducer to A cloud-based energy intelligence platform based 
utilizing AI and Blockchain to analyse pre and post consumption of before
and after the implementation of solutions recommended to achieve SLE.<br><br>
